# MMT Extended Addons
Repository of Addons for [MMT Extended](https://github.com/Zackptg5/MMT-Extended).

## Usage
- Place target addon folder to common/addon (ex: common/addon/External-Tools)
- Read the README in each repo addon folder to understand its purpose
- Don't delete or modify anything in the addon folder unless the readme states otherwise
- You can delete the folders of the addons you don't need
- Note that you can compress the addon folder into a tar.xz file to save space.

To compress to a tar.xz file, you can use the command `tar -cJf addon.tar.xz addon` from terminal or if using Windows, install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and compress the folder to addon.tar and then compress addon.tar to addon.tar.xz with ultra compression.

- You can create your own addons too. Just make an 'install.sh' script and it will be run automatically
